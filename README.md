Fetch
=================

####UPDATE: I had plans to host this as a web application on Heroku, but my inexperience with Heroku prevented me from doing so. The application is fully completed and everything works as it should. It uses 'fetch.py' to update the database file, and then 'server.py' to run on localhost using flask. Time to move on!

###What is Fetch?
Want to watch a movie? Don't want to deal with annoying ads on ThePirateBay?
Use Fetch, the all-in-one web scraper created in Python. Fetch allows users to retrieve the top HD movies on ThePirateBay, download optional subtitles and view the direct IMdb link! It also provides a nice picture of the movie too!
