Fetch
=================

###UPDATE: The app is back up, but retrieving IMDb thumbnails isn't working 100%.
###You must build from the source itself.

###What is Fetch?
Want to watch a movie? Don't want to deal with annoying ads on ThePirateBay?
Use Fetch, the all-in-one web scraper created in Python. Fetch allows users to retrieve the top HD movies on ThePirateBay, download optional subtitles and view the direct IMdb link! It also provides a nice picture of the movie too!
